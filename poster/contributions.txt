Code Contributions:

Responsibility for writing the code was split evenly between both tunaLandslide and tacox5.
The equations of motion were written in by tunaLandslide, while tacox5 helped with
code debugging and testing as well as generating the geometry of objects used to
test the distortion of light. Work on the ray-tracer was split evenly between
tunaLandslide and tacox5.

Poster Contributions:

Work on the poster was split evenly between tunaLandslide and tacox5. The sections
Background and Methods were written by tunaLandslide, while tacox5 worked on Results
and Summary and Future Work

Derivation:

The derivation of the equations of motion using the optical metric and its Langrangian
were done by tunaLandslide.
